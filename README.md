<h3>How It is Made:</h3>

<h5>Tech Stack Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</h5>

<p>Having worked on the frontline with adult population, lanuage barrrier has been one of the challenges caregivers and patients face and a barrier to client-centred care. I enjoy learning new languages and currently learning Spanish hence the inspiration for this app.
Using inspiration from the language app Duolingo, a collection of common phrases in the hospital are translated from english to spanish on click using an eventlistener in JavaScript. The translation in spanish are hidden until clicked. I hope to use a google translate API to improve this project so that more phrases with corresponding translations can be added.</p>

<h5>Lessons Learned</h5>

<p>Instead of hard coding all the various phrases used by in care settings, APIs for translation can be used to make this site more functional and inclusive of more folks.</p>
